    "Note that the pair of synergistic neurons contains more information in a similar way to the \"wisdom of the crowd\": When noise happens to disrupt the information of one neuron, the other neuron can compensate.  We can make this analogy with the cow-weight-guessing game more explicit by looking at whether the *average* (or, equivalently, the *sum*) over multiple neurons has more mutual information with the decision.  \n",
